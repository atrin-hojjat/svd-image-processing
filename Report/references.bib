abstract="The KSVD algorithm has been widely used in image processing fields due to its high efficiency for image sparse representation. The traditional KSVD alternately updates the dictionary atoms and sparse coefficients through iterative operations. The algorithm is with noise suppression ability, and the reconstructed image can maintain the internal structure information of the processed image. Thinking about the intrinsic structure information can be acquired by the dictionary update procedure, in this paper, the principal component analysis (PCA) process is adopted to replaces the singular value decomposition (SVD) performing on the error term, and the first principal component is extracted as update item for dictionary atom. Furthermore, the improved KSVD is applied to image denoising. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm can better reconstruct the essential features such as edge and texture of the denoising image, and obtain higher peak signal-to-noise ratio while significantly reducing the time consuming of the algorithm.",

abstract = {Face representation is a critical step in face recognition. Recently, singular value decomposition (SVD) based representation methods have attracted researchers×³ attentions for their power of alleviating the facial variations. The SVD representation reveals that the SVD basis set is important for the recognition purpose and the corresponding singular values (SVs) are regulated to form a more effective representation image. However, there exists a common problem in the existing SVD based representation methods: they all empirically make a rule to regulate the SVs, which is obviously not optimal in theory. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel method named learning discriminative singular value decomposition representation (LDSVDR) for face recognition. We build an individual SVD basis set for each image and then learn a common set of SVs by taking account of the information in the basis sets according to a discriminant criterion across the training images. The proposed model is solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular face databases and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method when dealing with variations of illumination, occlusion, disguise and face sketch recognition task.}
